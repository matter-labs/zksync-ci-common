# ZKsync Era: common CI actions and workflows for ZKsync repositories.

[![Logo](eraLogo.png)](https://zksync.io/)

ZKsync Era is a layer 2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum without compromising on security or
decentralization. Since it's EVM compatible (Solidity/Vyper), 99% of Ethereum projects can redeploy without refactoring
or re-auditing a single line of code. ZKsync Era also uses an LLVM-based compiler that will eventually let developers
write smart contracts in C++, Rust and other popular languages.

This repository contains common CI actions and workflows for ZKsync repositories.
